# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop user authentication system with multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
# Details:
1. Implement user registration flow
2. Create login system with MFA
3. Develop role-based permission system
4. Implement JWT token management
5. Create password reset flow
6. Develop session management
7. Implement audit logging for security events
8. Create user profile management

# Test Strategy:
1. Test registration process
2. Validate login with various MFA methods
3. Verify permission enforcement
4. Test token expiration and refresh
5. Validate password reset security
6. Verify session timeout handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement User Registration and Profile Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a complete user registration flow with email verification and user profile management functionality
### Details:
Develop a registration form with fields for username, email, password, and other required user information. Implement email verification using a token-based system. Create database schema for user profiles with appropriate fields. Implement form validation for all inputs. Add functionality for users to view and edit their profile information after registration. Ensure password storage follows security best practices with proper hashing and salting.

## 2. Develop Login System with Multi-Factor Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Create a secure login system that supports username/password authentication with optional multi-factor authentication methods
### Details:
Implement a login form with username/password authentication. Add support for multi-factor authentication using methods like SMS, email codes, or authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator). Create interfaces for users to enable/disable MFA and manage their MFA settings. Implement rate limiting for failed login attempts. Add remember-me functionality for trusted devices. Create a secure cookie management system for maintaining login state.

## 3. Implement JWT Token Management and Session Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a complete JWT token system for authentication with proper token issuance, validation, refresh, and session management
### Details:
Implement JWT token generation with appropriate claims (user ID, roles, expiration). Create middleware for token validation on protected routes. Develop token refresh mechanism to extend sessions without requiring re-login. Implement secure token storage on client-side. Add functionality to revoke tokens when needed (logout, password change). Create session tracking with the ability to view and terminate active sessions across devices.

## 4. Develop Role-Based Access Control System [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Create a flexible role-based permission system that controls access to different parts of the application
### Details:
Design and implement a database schema for roles and permissions. Create admin interfaces for managing roles and assigning them to users. Implement middleware to check permissions for protected routes and resources. Develop a hierarchical role system with inheritance capabilities. Add functionality to dynamically adjust UI elements based on user permissions. Create helper functions/decorators to easily protect routes and API endpoints.

## 5. Implement Password Reset and Security Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Create a secure password reset flow and implement comprehensive security event logging
### Details:
Develop a password reset flow using email verification with secure tokens. Implement token expiration and single-use validation for reset links. Create forms for requesting password reset and setting new password. Add password strength requirements and validation. Implement comprehensive audit logging for security events (login attempts, password changes, permission changes, etc.). Create an admin interface to view security logs with filtering and search capabilities. Implement automated alerts for suspicious activities.
