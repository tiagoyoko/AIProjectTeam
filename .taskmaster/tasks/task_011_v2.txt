# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Risk Identification and Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms to identify potential risks from project data and classify them into appropriate categories (e.g., technical, financial, operational, etc.)
### Details:
Create a module that uses NLP techniques to scan project documents, requirements, and historical data to identify potential risks. Implement classification algorithms using predefined risk categories. The system should extract key risk indicators and assign initial risk categories. Use a combination of keyword matching, pattern recognition, and machine learning classification techniques. Store identified risks in a structured format with metadata including source, date identified, and initial classification.

## 2. Develop Risk Assessment Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a system to evaluate identified risks by calculating probability and impact scores, and generate a comprehensive risk matrix
### Details:
Build an assessment engine that assigns probability scores (1-5) and impact scores (1-5) to each identified risk. Implement algorithms to calculate these scores based on historical data, expert rules, and contextual factors. Generate a risk matrix that visually represents risks by plotting them on probability vs. impact axes. Include functionality to categorize risks as low, medium, or high based on their position in the matrix. The engine should support both automated scoring and manual adjustment by users.

## 3. Create Risk Response Planning System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a component that generates appropriate risk response strategies (avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept) and detailed action plans for each identified risk
### Details:
Implement a system that recommends appropriate response strategies based on risk characteristics and severity. For each risk, generate specific action plans with steps, resources required, and timelines. Include templates for common risk responses that can be customized. The system should prioritize response actions based on risk severity from the risk matrix. Incorporate a knowledge base of effective response strategies from historical projects. Allow for collaborative refinement of response plans.

## 4. Implement Risk Monitoring and Trigger System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop functionality to track risks over time, identify trigger events that may activate risks, and alert stakeholders when triggers occur
### Details:
Create a monitoring system that tracks risk indicators and project metrics to detect when risks are becoming more likely. Implement trigger identification algorithms that define specific events or thresholds that signal risk activation. Build an alerting mechanism that notifies appropriate stakeholders when triggers are detected. Include dashboards for visualizing risk status and trends over time. The system should support scheduled risk reviews and automated status updates. Implement a feedback loop to improve trigger accuracy based on actual outcomes.

## 5. Develop Risk Register and Contingency Planning System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive risk register maintenance system and functionality to generate contingency plans for high-priority risks
### Details:
Build a risk register database that maintains complete information about all identified risks, including status, history, and associated response plans. Implement contingency plan generation for high-priority risks, including detailed fallback actions, resource requirements, and execution timelines. Create functionality for regular risk register updates, archiving resolved risks, and adding new risks. Include reporting capabilities to generate risk summaries for different stakeholder groups. The system should maintain an audit trail of all risk-related activities and decisions. Implement version control for risk information and contingency plans.
