### Details:
1. Implement methods to create/update/delete spaces in ClickUp
2. Add functionality to create/update/delete folders within spaces
3. Implement list creation and management within folders
4. Create a mapping system between application project structures and ClickUp structures
5. Implement template-based structure generation for new projects
6. Add validation to ensure structures are created correctly

## 3. Implement Task Creation and Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop functionality to create, update, and delete tasks in ClickUp, including task details, assignees, due dates, and priorities.
### Details:
1. Create methods for task CRUD operations
2. Implement assignee management functionality
3. Add support for task properties (priority, due dates, time estimates)
4. Develop batch operations for creating multiple tasks
5. Implement task relationship handling (subtasks, dependencies)
6. Create bidirectional mapping between application tasks and ClickUp tasks
7. Add task search and filtering capabilities

## 4. Create Custom Field Mapping and Status Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Implement mapping between application data fields and ClickUp custom fields, and synchronize status changes between systems.
### Details:
1. Create a configuration system for custom field mapping
2. Implement methods to create and update custom fields in ClickUp
3. Develop bidirectional synchronization of field values
4. Create status mapping between application statuses and ClickUp statuses
5. Implement status change detection and synchronization
6. Add validation for field type compatibility
7. Create conflict resolution strategies for concurrent updates

## 5. Implement Webhooks and Real-time Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4
### Description: Develop webhook handlers for real-time updates from ClickUp and implement time tracking and comment synchronization.
### Details:
1. Create webhook registration and management with ClickUp
2. Implement webhook handlers for various event types (task updates, comments, etc.)
3. Develop time tracking integration for synchronizing work logs
4. Create comment synchronization between systems
5. Implement queuing system for handling webhook events
6. Add retry mechanisms for failed synchronizations
7. Create admin dashboard for monitoring synchronization status
