2. Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) generator
3. Develop requirements elicitation capabilities
4. Implement scope validation logic
5. Create scope change management process
6. Develop deliverables tracking system
7. Implement acceptance criteria definition
8. Create scope exclusion identification logic

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate project charter completeness
2. Test WBS generation with sample projects
3. Verify requirements extraction from conversations
4. Test scope change impact analysis
5. Validate deliverables tracking accuracy
6. Verify acceptance criteria clarity

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Project Charter Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module that generates comprehensive project charters based on user inputs and project requirements
### Details:
Develop a class that takes project information (name, objectives, stakeholders, high-level requirements) and generates a structured project charter document. Implement templates for different project types and ensure the generator includes sections for project purpose, measurable objectives, high-level requirements, assumptions/constraints, and key stakeholders. Use natural language processing to help refine user inputs into professional charter language.

## 2. Build Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop a component that creates hierarchical WBS from project scope statements
### Details:
Create a WBS generator that decomposes project deliverables into manageable components. Implement algorithms to analyze project scope and suggest appropriate work packages. Include functionality to visualize the WBS in tree structure format, allow manual adjustments, and export to common formats (CSV, JSON). Ensure the WBS follows the 100% rule where child elements represent 100% of the parent.

## 3. Develop Requirements Elicitation and Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a system for gathering, documenting, and managing project requirements
### Details:
Implement a requirements management system that supports elicitation through guided questioning, templates, and stakeholder input collection. Build functionality to categorize requirements (functional, non-functional, business, etc.), assign unique identifiers, track requirement versions, and establish traceability matrices. Include natural language processing to detect ambiguity and suggest improvements to requirement statements.

## 4. Implement Scope Validation and Acceptance Criteria Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create a framework for defining acceptance criteria and validating deliverables against scope
### Details:
Develop a system that helps define clear acceptance criteria for each deliverable in the WBS. Implement validation workflows that check deliverables against defined criteria. Create templates for different types of acceptance criteria (functional, performance, compliance). Build reporting capabilities to track validation status across all project deliverables. Include functionality to generate formal acceptance documents.

## 5. Create Scope Change Management and Control System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Develop a system to manage scope changes, exclusions, and track deliverables throughout the project lifecycle
### Details:
Implement a scope change management system that includes change request workflows, impact analysis tools, and approval processes. Create functionality to identify and document scope exclusions explicitly. Develop a deliverables tracking system that monitors progress, status, and changes to project deliverables. Include dashboards for visualizing scope stability and change metrics. Implement version control for scope documentation to maintain historical records of all changes.
