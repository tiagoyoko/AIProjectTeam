# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Orchestrator Agent Core Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main orchestrator agent that coordinates requests and distributes tasks to specialist agents
# Details:
1. Implement request analysis logic to determine intent
2. Create task distribution system to appropriate specialist agents
3. Develop response synthesis from multiple agent inputs
4. Implement proactive monitoring and alerting capabilities
5. Create decision-making logic for process optimization
6. Develop adaptive communication style based on user preferences
7. Implement methodology selection logic (PMBOK, Scrum, etc.)
8. Create output formatting system for consistent responses

# Test Strategy:
1. Test intent recognition with sample requests
2. Verify correct specialist agent selection
3. Validate response quality from synthesized inputs
4. Test proactive alert generation for project risks
5. Verify methodology adaptation based on project type
6. Evaluate communication style adaptation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Request Analysis and Intent Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core logic for analyzing incoming requests and determining the user's intent to properly route tasks to specialist agents.
### Details:
Develop a module that parses incoming requests using NLP techniques to extract key information such as request type, priority, and specific requirements. Implement intent classification using a combination of keyword matching and semantic analysis. Create a structured representation of the request that can be used by downstream components. Include confidence scoring for intent detection to handle ambiguous requests.

## 2. Build Task Distribution System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the system that routes tasks to appropriate specialist agents based on the analyzed intent and requirements.
### Details:
Create a registry system for specialist agents that tracks their capabilities, availability, and performance metrics. Implement a routing algorithm that matches request intents to specialist capabilities. Design a queue management system for handling multiple concurrent requests. Include load balancing logic to prevent overloading specific agents. Implement fallback mechanisms for when ideal specialists are unavailable.

## 3. Develop Response Synthesis Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the system that collects, integrates, and synthesizes responses from multiple specialist agents into a coherent final response.
### Details:
Implement a collector module that gathers responses from all involved specialist agents. Create a conflict resolution system for handling contradictory information from different specialists. Develop a response composition engine that integrates multiple inputs while maintaining a consistent voice. Implement priority weighting for different specialist inputs based on their relevance to the original request. Include mechanisms for requesting clarification from specialists when needed.

## 4. Implement Methodology Selection and Adaptation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create the logic for selecting appropriate methodologies (PMBOK, Scrum, etc.) and adapting communication style based on user preferences.
### Details:
Develop a system to identify and store user preferences regarding project methodologies and communication styles. Implement logic to select the appropriate methodology based on request context and user history. Create templates and frameworks for different methodologies that can be applied to responses. Build an adaptation layer that adjusts terminology, detail level, and formatting based on user preferences. Include a feedback mechanism to refine methodology selection over time.

## 5. Develop Monitoring, Alerting, and Output Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement proactive monitoring capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and consistent output formatting for the orchestrator.
### Details:
Create a monitoring system that tracks request processing status, specialist agent performance, and system health. Implement alerting logic for detecting and responding to issues like delayed responses or specialist failures. Develop a comprehensive logging system for debugging and performance analysis. Build an output formatting module that ensures consistent response structure regardless of the specialists involved. Implement different output formats (text, structured data, etc.) based on request requirements.
