# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Real-time Data Collection Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a service that collects real-time data from various project sources and stores it in a centralized database for further processing.
### Details:
Develop a service using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time data streaming. Implement adapters for different data sources (e.g., project management tools, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure monitoring). Create a data normalization layer to standardize incoming data formats. Use a time-series database like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for efficient storage of time-stamped metrics. Implement data validation and error handling for reliable data collection.

## 2. Develop KPI Calculation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Create a calculation engine that processes the collected data to compute key performance indicators (KPIs) based on predefined formulas and business rules.
### Details:
Design a modular calculation engine that supports different KPI types (e.g., velocity, quality, cost). Implement configurable calculation formulas using a rules engine approach. Create a caching mechanism for frequently accessed KPIs to improve performance. Develop a historical KPI tracking system to store calculated values over time. Implement a versioning system for KPI definitions to track changes in calculation methods.

## 3. Implement Threshold-based Alerting and Trend Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system that monitors KPIs against predefined thresholds and analyzes trends to identify potential issues before they become critical.
### Details:
Create a configurable threshold management system with support for static and dynamic thresholds. Implement trend analysis algorithms (e.g., moving averages, regression analysis) to detect patterns. Develop a priority classification system for alerts based on severity and impact. Create a trend visualization component to display historical patterns. Implement seasonality detection to adjust for normal cyclical variations in metrics.

## 4. Build Anomaly Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Develop an anomaly detection system that uses machine learning to identify unusual patterns in the data that may indicate problems requiring attention.
### Details:
Implement statistical anomaly detection methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR). Develop machine learning models (e.g., isolation forests, autoencoders) for more complex pattern recognition. Create a training pipeline for model updates based on new data. Implement a feedback mechanism to improve detection accuracy based on user input. Design a system to correlate anomalies across multiple metrics to reduce false positives.

## 5. Create Notification Delivery and Dashboard System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Develop a notification system that delivers alerts through multiple channels and implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring KPIs and alerts.
### Details:
Implement notification delivery through multiple channels (email, SMS, Slack, in-app). Create a notification preference management system for users. Develop a real-time dashboard using a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) with WebSocket connections. Implement dashboard components for KPI visualization, alert display, and trend charts. Create alert prioritization logic to prevent notification fatigue. Develop a user-friendly interface for acknowledging and managing alerts.
