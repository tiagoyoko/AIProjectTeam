# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement End-to-End Encryption for Messages [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement an end-to-end encryption system for all message communications within the application using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
### Details:

5. Implement message signature verification
6. Document the encryption architecture

## 2. Implement Data Encryption at Rest [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to encrypt sensitive data stored in databases and file systems to protect information when it's not being actively used.
### Details:
1. Identify all sensitive data categories requiring encryption
2. Implement database column-level encryption for PII
3. Create secure key management system for data-at-rest keys
4. Implement transparent data encryption for database backups

6. Implement key rotation mechanisms

## 3. Develop Secure API Communication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement security measures for all API endpoints including authentication, authorization, and secure data transmission.
### Details:
1. Implement TLS 1.3 for all API communications
2. Create JWT-based authentication system with proper signing
3. Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Add request validation and sanitization
5. Implement proper CORS configuration
6. Create API authorization middleware based on user roles
7. Add API request logging for security auditing

## 4. Implement Security Headers and Vulnerability Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure security headers for all HTTP responses and implement automated vulnerability scanning in the CI/CD pipeline.
### Details:
1. Implement Content-Security-Policy headers
2. Add Strict-Transport-Security headers
3. Configure X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy

7. Implement reporting system for discovered vulnerabilities

## 5. Create Security Compliance Documentation and Incident Response [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for security compliance (LGPD/GDPR) and implement a security incident response plan.
### Details:
1. Document all data processing activities
2. Create data protection impact assessment
3. Develop privacy policy and terms of service
4. Implement data subject rights management system
5. Create security incident response playbooks
6. Develop breach notification procedures
