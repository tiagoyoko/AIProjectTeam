# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Project Closure Checklist Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a component that generates comprehensive project closure checklists based on project type, size, and specific requirements. The checklist should cover all necessary steps for proper project closure including documentation, stakeholder sign-offs, and resource release.
### Details:
Develop a function that takes project metadata as input and outputs a customized closure checklist. Use a template-based approach with conditional logic to include/exclude items based on project attributes. Store checklist templates in a structured format (JSON) that can be easily maintained and extended. Implement a UI component for displaying and interacting with the checklist, allowing users to mark items as complete and add notes.

## 2. Create Lessons Learned Collection Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop a framework for systematically collecting, categorizing, and storing lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. This should include mechanisms for team members to submit observations, challenges, solutions, and recommendations.
### Details:
Implement a data model for lessons learned entries with fields for category, impact level, description, context, and suggested improvements. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations on lessons learned entries. Develop a user interface for submitting and browsing lessons, with filtering and search capabilities. Include a collaborative feature allowing team members to comment on and refine lessons learned entries.

## 3. Develop Project Performance Analysis Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create a module that analyzes project performance against initial plans and industry benchmarks. This should include metrics on schedule adherence, budget performance, quality outcomes, and team productivity.
### Details:
Implement data collection interfaces to gather performance metrics from project management tools. Develop algorithms to compare actual vs. planned performance across key dimensions. Create visualization components to present performance data through charts and dashboards. Include trend analysis to identify patterns across project phases. Implement export functionality for including analysis in final reports.

## 4. Implement Improvement Recommendation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Build an intelligent system that generates specific improvement recommendations based on lessons learned and performance analysis. The engine should identify patterns across projects and suggest actionable improvements for future initiatives.
### Details:
Develop a recommendation algorithm that processes lessons learned data and performance metrics to identify improvement opportunities. Implement categorization of recommendations by impact level and implementation difficulty. Create a knowledge base of common improvement patterns that can be matched against project data. Build a user interface for reviewing, prioritizing, and acting on recommendations. Include functionality to track implementation of recommendations across projects.

## 5. Create Project Archive Organization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Develop a system for organizing and preserving all project artifacts, documentation, and knowledge in a structured archive that facilitates future reference and knowledge reuse.
### Details:
Implement a hierarchical storage structure for project artifacts with appropriate metadata tagging. Create indexing and search capabilities to locate specific information within archives. Develop access control mechanisms to manage permissions while enabling knowledge sharing. Build integration with existing document management systems. Implement archiving workflows that guide users through the process of properly documenting and storing project information. Include features for creating executive summaries and knowledge transfer packages.
