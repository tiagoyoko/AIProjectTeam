# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Data Aggregation and Storage Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust data aggregation system that collects and normalizes data from various project sources, storing it in an optimized format for analytics processing.
### Details:
Develop a data pipeline that extracts project data from databases, APIs, and file systems. Implement ETL processes to clean, transform, and normalize the data. Create a data schema optimized for analytics queries with appropriate indexing. Implement incremental data loading to handle large datasets efficiently. Use a combination of batch processing for historical data and near real-time processing for recent updates.

## 2. Develop Trend Identification and Benchmark Comparison Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create algorithms to identify trends in project data over time and compare performance against internal and industry benchmarks.
### Details:
Implement time-series analysis algorithms to detect patterns and trends in project metrics. Create statistical models for anomaly detection to highlight significant deviations. Develop benchmark comparison functionality that normalizes data against industry standards and internal targets. Implement correlation analysis to identify relationships between different metrics. Use machine learning techniques like regression analysis for trend prediction.

## 3. Build Recommendation and Predictive Analytics Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an engine that generates actionable recommendations based on data insights and creates predictive models for future project outcomes.
### Details:
Implement a rule-based system for generating basic recommendations based on detected patterns. Develop machine learning models (regression, classification, clustering) for more sophisticated predictions. Create a feedback mechanism to improve recommendation quality over time. Implement feature engineering to extract meaningful variables from raw data. Design a scoring system to prioritize recommendations by potential impact.

## 4. Implement Custom Metric Definition and Calculation System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible system allowing users to define, calculate, and track custom metrics and KPIs specific to their project needs.
### Details:
Design a user interface for defining custom metrics using a combination of existing data points and formulas. Implement a calculation engine that can process custom metric definitions efficiently. Create a caching mechanism for frequently accessed metrics. Develop a validation system to ensure metric definitions are valid and performant. Implement version control for metric definitions to track changes over time.

## 5. Develop Visualization Generation and Insight Delivery System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system for generating visual representations of analytics data and delivering actionable insights to users through various channels.
### Details:
Implement a visualization library that supports various chart types (line, bar, scatter, heat maps, etc.). Create templates for common insight presentations. Develop an export system for reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, interactive HTML). Implement notification systems for delivering insights via email, in-app alerts, and API webhooks. Create a scheduling system for regular report generation and delivery. Design interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data dynamically.
