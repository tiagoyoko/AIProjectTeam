# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Quality Criteria Definition Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a framework that allows the agent to define, categorize, and prioritize quality criteria for software projects based on project type, requirements, and industry standards.
### Details:
Develop a structured data model for quality criteria that includes categories (functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, portability), importance levels, and measurement methods. Implement functions to generate appropriate quality criteria based on project inputs. Create a knowledge base of industry standards (ISO 9126, IEEE, etc.) that the agent can reference. Build an interface for users to customize and extend the criteria.

## 2. Create Quality Management Plan Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop functionality to automatically generate comprehensive quality management plans tailored to specific project requirements and the defined quality criteria.
### Details:
Build a template-based system for quality management plans with sections for quality objectives, organizational structure, documentation requirements, reviews, and quality control activities. Implement logic to populate templates based on project parameters and quality criteria. Create visualization components for quality processes and responsibilities. Include mechanisms for plan versioning and approval workflows.

## 3. Develop Test Planning Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Implement functionality for the agent to create comprehensive test plans, including test strategy, test cases, and test schedules based on the quality criteria and project requirements.
### Details:
Create algorithms to identify testable requirements and generate appropriate test cases. Implement test coverage analysis to ensure all quality criteria are adequately tested. Develop test prioritization based on risk assessment. Build functionality to estimate testing effort and create realistic test schedules. Include support for different testing methodologies (unit, integration, system, acceptance) and approaches (manual, automated).

## 4. Implement Quality Metrics Tracking and Baseline Establishment [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a system for defining, collecting, analyzing, and visualizing quality metrics, along with establishing quality baselines for future comparison and improvement.
### Details:
Develop a metrics framework that includes product quality metrics (defect density, test coverage), process metrics (review efficiency, defect detection rate), and project metrics (quality costs, schedule adherence). Implement data collection interfaces for automated and manual input. Create statistical analysis functions for trend analysis and anomaly detection. Build visualization dashboards for metrics reporting. Develop algorithms to establish quality baselines based on historical data and industry benchmarks.

## 5. Create Defect Prevention Analysis and Continuous Improvement Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Develop capabilities for analyzing root causes of defects, implementing preventive measures, and establishing a continuous quality improvement process.
### Details:
Implement root cause analysis techniques (Pareto analysis, fishbone diagrams, 5 Whys) for defect categorization. Create a knowledge base of common defects and prevention strategies. Develop recommendation algorithms for preventive actions based on defect patterns. Build a continuous improvement framework with plan-do-check-act cycles. Implement quality audit procedures to verify process adherence. Create feedback loops from metrics analysis to quality criteria refinement and test planning improvements.
