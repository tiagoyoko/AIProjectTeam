# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Task Duration Estimation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module that estimates task durations based on historical data, complexity factors, and team velocity metrics.
### Details:
Develop algorithms that analyze task attributes (complexity, size, type) and historical completion times to generate realistic duration estimates. Implement multiple estimation methods including PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique), analogous estimation, and parametric models. Create an interface that allows for manual adjustments and confidence intervals for estimates.

## 2. Develop Critical Path Analysis Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build a system to identify the critical path in project schedules, calculate float times, and highlight bottleneck tasks.
### Details:
Implement a directed graph representation of tasks and dependencies. Create algorithms to calculate earliest start/finish and latest start/finish times for each task. Identify the critical path by finding tasks with zero float. Develop visualization helpers to highlight the critical path in schedule views. Include functionality to recalculate the critical path when task durations or dependencies change.

## 3. Create Schedule Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop components for visualizing project schedules as Gantt charts, timeline views, and resource allocation graphs.
### Details:
Implement a Gantt chart generator that displays tasks, durations, dependencies, and the critical path. Create interactive features allowing users to adjust task dates and dependencies directly on the chart. Develop resource allocation views showing team member workloads over time. Include export functionality for common formats (PNG, PDF, CSV). Ensure visualizations are responsive and accessible.

## 4. Implement Sprint Planning and Agile Scheduling Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create functionality for agile sprint planning, including backlog prioritization, capacity planning, and sprint generation.
### Details:
Develop algorithms to suggest optimal sprint compositions based on task priorities, dependencies, and team capacity. Implement velocity tracking and forecasting to improve sprint planning accuracy. Create interfaces for drag-and-drop backlog refinement and sprint assignment. Include burndown/burnup chart generation. Develop sprint health metrics and early warning indicators for at-risk sprints.

## 5. Develop Schedule Optimization and Risk Analysis System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create advanced features for schedule optimization, resource leveling, risk analysis, and baseline tracking.
### Details:
Implement resource leveling algorithms to balance workloads and resolve over-allocations. Develop Monte Carlo simulation for schedule risk analysis, identifying probability distributions for project completion dates. Create optimization suggestions based on critical path analysis and resource constraints. Implement baseline tracking to compare actual progress against planned schedules. Develop early warning systems for schedule slippage and resource bottlenecks.
