# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Report Template Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible template engine that allows defining report structures with placeholders for dynamic content.
### Details:
Develop a template system using a library like Handlebars or Mustache that supports variable substitution, conditional sections, and loops. Create a base template class with methods for rendering content and applying styles. Implement at least three basic templates (tabular, summary, and detailed) that can be extended. Store templates in a database or file system with version control.

## 2. Build Data Aggregation Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Develop a service that can query, filter, and aggregate data from multiple sources for inclusion in reports.
### Details:
Create a data service layer that connects to relevant databases and APIs. Implement query builders for common data needs. Develop aggregation functions (sum, average, count, etc.) and filtering capabilities. Include caching mechanisms for performance optimization. Create data transformers that convert raw data into formats compatible with the template engine.

## 3. Implement Visualization Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to generate charts, graphs, and other visual elements based on aggregated data.
### Details:
Integrate a visualization library like D3.js, Chart.js, or Highcharts. Create wrapper classes for common chart types (bar, line, pie, etc.). Implement a configuration system that allows customizing colors, labels, and other visual properties. Ensure visualizations are responsive and accessible. Add export capabilities for individual charts as images.

## 4. Develop Export and Delivery System [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.3
### Description: Create functionality to export reports in various formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) and deliver them to stakeholders via email or dashboard.
### Details:
Implement export adapters for each format using appropriate libraries (e.g., PDFKit for PDF, ExcelJS for Excel). Create a unified export API that handles format conversion. Develop an email delivery service that can attach reports and include summary information. Implement a dashboard component for viewing reports in-browser. Add scheduling capabilities for automated report generation and delivery.

## 5. Implement Interactive Report Elements [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Add interactive features to reports such as filters, drilldowns, and customizable views for web-based report consumption.
### Details:
Create client-side components for interactive filtering and sorting of report data. Implement drill-down capabilities to explore hierarchical data. Add user preference storage to remember view settings. Develop real-time updating for dashboard reports. Implement stakeholder-specific views that show/hide elements based on user roles. Ensure all interactive elements work on both desktop and mobile devices.
