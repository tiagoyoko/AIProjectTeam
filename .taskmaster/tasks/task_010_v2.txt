# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Cost Management Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the specialist agent for cost estimation, budget control, and financial analysis
# Details:
1. Implement cost estimation techniques (analogous, parametric, bottom-up)
2. Create budget allocation algorithms
3. Develop ROI and payback calculation
4. Implement earned value management (EVM) calculations
5. Create cost variance analysis
6. Develop cash flow projection
7. Implement financial viability assessment
8. Create CAPEX/OPEX categorization

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate cost estimates against industry benchmarks
2. Test budget allocation across project components
3. Verify ROI calculations with test scenarios
4. Test EVM metrics (CPI, SPI) calculation
5. Validate cost variance detection
6. Verify financial projection accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Cost Estimation Techniques [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms for the three main cost estimation techniques: analogous (using historical data), parametric (using statistical relationships), and bottom-up (detailed component estimation).
### Details:
Create a CostEstimator class with methods for each estimation technique. For analogous estimation, implement historical data comparison with similarity scoring. For parametric estimation, develop statistical models using regression analysis. For bottom-up estimation, create a component breakdown structure with aggregation logic. Include data validation and confidence intervals for each estimate.

## 2. Develop Budget Allocation and Control System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a system for allocating budgets across project components and tracking actual vs. planned expenditures with alerts for overruns.
### Details:
Implement a BudgetManager class that handles initial allocation based on cost estimates. Create methods for budget reallocation, tracking actual costs, calculating variances, and generating threshold-based alerts. Include visualization components for budget distribution and consumption over time.

## 3. Create Financial Analysis Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop functionality for ROI calculation, payback period analysis, and financial viability assessment including NPV and IRR calculations.
### Details:
Implement a FinancialAnalyzer class with methods for calculating ROI, payback period, NPV, and IRR. Include sensitivity analysis capabilities to test different scenarios. Create visualization methods for financial projections and comparison charts. Support both deterministic and probabilistic analysis approaches.

## 4. Implement Earned Value Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system for tracking project performance using EVM metrics including SPI, CPI, CV, SV, EAC, and ETC calculations.
### Details:
Develop an EVMCalculator class that integrates with the budget system. Implement methods for calculating all standard EVM metrics. Create functionality for time-phased baseline creation and variance analysis. Include forecasting capabilities based on current performance trends. Develop visualization components for EVM metrics over time.

## 5. Develop Cash Flow and Cost Categorization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Create functionality for cash flow projections, cost variance analysis, and automatic categorization of expenses into CAPEX/OPEX.
### Details:
Implement a CashFlowManager class for time-phased expenditure projections. Create a CostCategorizer class with ML-based classification for CAPEX/OPEX categorization. Develop variance analysis tools that identify root causes of deviations. Include reporting capabilities for financial planning and tax purposes. Integrate with the budget and EVM systems for comprehensive financial management.
