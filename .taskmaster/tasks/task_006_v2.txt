# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Agent Orchestration Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core orchestration system that coordinates between the main orchestrator agent and specialist agents
# Details:
1. Evaluate and select appropriate agent framework (LangChain, AutoGen, etc.)
2. Implement agent communication protocol
3. Create agent state management system
4. Develop task routing logic based on agent specialties
5. Implement conversation context management
6. Create agent memory system for persistent knowledge
7. Develop error handling and recovery mechanisms
8. Implement logging for agent interactions for auditability

# Test Strategy:
1. Test inter-agent communication with mock agents
2. Verify correct task routing based on content analysis
3. Validate context preservation across agent handoffs
4. Test recovery from agent failures
5. Measure orchestration overhead and optimize
6. Verify audit trail completeness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Evaluate and Select Agent Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and compare agent frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and others to determine the most suitable one for our orchestration needs.
### Details:
1. Create a comparison matrix of at least 3 frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI)
2. Evaluate each based on: flexibility, documentation quality, community support, performance, and integration capabilities
3. Test basic agent communication in each framework with a simple proof of concept
4. Document findings with pros/cons of each option
5. Make a final recommendation with justification
6. Set up the project with the selected framework

## 2. Implement Agent Communication Protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Design and implement the protocol that enables seamless communication between the orchestrator agent and specialist agents.
### Details:
1. Define message structure for agent communication (including headers, payload format, metadata)
2. Implement serialization/deserialization of messages
3. Create communication channels between agents (synchronous and asynchronous options)
4. Implement message routing logic
5. Add validation for message integrity
6. Create retry mechanisms for failed communications
7. Document the protocol specification for future agent implementations

## 3. Develop Agent State Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to track and manage the state of all agents in the ecosystem, including their availability, current tasks, and capabilities.
### Details:
1. Design a state model for agents (available, busy, error, initializing, etc.)
2. Implement state transitions and validation logic
3. Create a central state registry for tracking all agents
4. Develop state persistence mechanism for recovery after system restarts
5. Implement state query interface for the orchestrator
6. Add state change notifications/events
7. Create visualization tools for current system state

## 4. Implement Task Routing and Specialist Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Develop the logic that determines which specialist agent should handle a given task based on capabilities, current load, and past performance.
### Details:
1. Create a capability registry for specialist agents
2. Implement task classification logic to identify required capabilities
3. Develop routing algorithms that consider agent load balancing
4. Add priority handling for urgent tasks
5. Implement fallback mechanisms when ideal specialists are unavailable
6. Create performance tracking to improve future routing decisions
7. Develop interfaces for manual routing overrides when needed

## 5. Develop Conversation Context and Memory System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create a system that maintains conversation history, context, and persistent knowledge across agent interactions.
### Details:
1. Design a schema for storing conversation history and context
2. Implement context passing between agents during handoffs
3. Create a memory persistence layer (database integration)
4. Develop context retrieval mechanisms based on relevance
5. Implement context summarization for long conversations
6. Add memory management policies (retention, archiving, etc.)
7. Create interfaces for agents to query and update shared memory
8. Implement logging for all agent interactions for auditability
