# Task ID: 1
# Title: Configure Initial Project Environment with Monorepo Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational project environment including monorepo structure, Git repository configuration, development tools, and basic CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
1. Create a monorepo structure:
   - Initialize the project using a tool like Nx, Turborepo, or Lerna
   - Set up appropriate folder structure for different applications/packages
   - Configure shared dependencies and workspaces

2. Git repository setup:
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions
   - Configure Git hooks for pre-commit linting and formatting
   - Set up branch protection rules and contribution guidelines
   - Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions

3. Development tools configuration:
   - Install and configure ESLint for code linting
   - Set up Prettier for code formatting
   - Configure TypeScript (if applicable)
   - Install testing frameworks (Jest, etc.)
   - Set up build tools and bundlers as needed
   - Configure editor settings (.editorconfig)

4. Basic CI/CD pipeline:
   - Set up GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar CI/CD tool
   - Configure basic pipeline for linting, testing, and building
   - Set up automated dependency updates (Dependabot, Renovate)
   - Implement basic deployment workflow for development environment

5. Documentation:
   - Document the environment setup process
   - Create developer onboarding guide
   - Document available scripts and commands

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify monorepo structure:
   - Ensure all necessary folders and configuration files exist
   - Validate that workspace configuration is correct
   - Test cross-package dependencies and imports

2. Test Git configuration:
   - Verify Git hooks are working by making test commits
   - Ensure .gitignore is properly excluding files
   - Check that branch protection rules are enforced

3. Validate development tools:
   - Run linting and formatting commands to verify configuration
   - Make intentional linting/formatting errors to confirm tools catch them
   - Verify TypeScript compilation works correctly
   - Run test suite to ensure testing framework is properly configured

4. CI/CD verification:
   - Push changes to trigger CI pipeline
   - Verify all pipeline stages complete successfully
   - Test the deployment process to development environment
   - Confirm that automated dependency updates are working

5. Documentation review:
   - Have a team member follow the setup documentation to verify completeness
   - Ensure all commands and scripts are documented and working as described
   - Verify that the onboarding process is clear and comprehensive
