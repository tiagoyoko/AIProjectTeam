# Task ID: 1
# Title: Configure Initial Project Environment with Monorepo, TypeScript, Docker and Development Tools
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational project structure using a monorepo architecture with TypeScript configuration, Docker containerization, and essential development tools to ensure a consistent development environment.
# Details:
1. Initialize the monorepo structure:
   - Use a tool like Nx, Lerna, or Turborepo to set up the monorepo
   - Create the basic folder structure (packages/apps, shared libraries, etc.)
   - Configure workspaces in package.json

2. Set up TypeScript configuration:
   - Create a base tsconfig.json in the root directory
   - Configure path aliases for cross-package imports
   - Set up appropriate TypeScript compiler options (strict mode, target ES version)
   - Create extended configurations for different package types (frontend, backend, libraries)

3. Docker configuration:
   - Create a Dockerfile for development environment
   - Set up docker-compose.yml for multi-container services
   - Configure volume mappings for code changes
   - Set up appropriate networking between containers

4. Development tools setup:
   - Configure ESLint with TypeScript support
   - Set up Prettier for code formatting
   - Add Jest or other testing framework configuration
   - Configure Git hooks with Husky for pre-commit linting and testing
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration files (.github/workflows or equivalent)

5. Documentation:
   - Create README.md with setup instructions
   - Document the project structure and conventions
   - Add contributing guidelines

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify monorepo structure:
   - Ensure all necessary configuration files exist
   - Validate that packages can reference each other
   - Test the build process across multiple packages

2. Test TypeScript configuration:
   - Verify TypeScript compilation works without errors
   - Confirm path aliases work correctly between packages
   - Check that appropriate type checking is enforced

3. Validate Docker setup:
   - Build the Docker image(s) successfully
   - Run the development environment using docker-compose
   - Verify that code changes are reflected in the running containers
   - Test that all services can communicate as expected

4. Test development tools:
   - Run ESLint to ensure it catches style issues
   - Verify Prettier formats code according to project standards
   - Run test suite to confirm testing framework is properly configured
   - Test Git hooks by making a commit with linting errors

5. Documentation verification:
   - Follow the setup instructions from scratch on a clean environment
   - Ensure another developer can successfully set up the project using only the documentation

6. Configure workspace-specific scripts for build, test, and lint commands
7. Set up cross-workspace dependency references

## 2. Configure TypeScript Environment with Path Aliases [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive TypeScript configuration that supports strict typing, module resolution, and path aliases for cross-package imports.
### Details:
1. Create a base tsconfig.json in the root with:
   - `strict: true`
   - `target: ES2020`
   - `module: ESNext`
   - Appropriate lib settings
2. Configure path aliases using `paths` and `baseUrl`
3. Create extended tsconfig files:
   - tsconfig.base.json (for shared settings)
   - tsconfig.app.json (for applications)
   - tsconfig.lib.json (for libraries)
4. Set up appropriate module resolution strategy
5. Configure source and output directories
6. Add TypeScript compiler options for better type safety
7. Set up declaration file generation for libraries

## 3. Implement Docker Containerization for Development [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create Docker configuration files for containerized development environment with appropriate service definitions and networking.
### Details:
1. Create a base Dockerfile for development:
   - Use Node.js LTS as base image
   - Install required global dependencies
   - Configure appropriate working directory
2. Create docker-compose.yml with:
   - Service definitions for each application
   - Volume mappings for code changes
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Port mappings for services
   - Network configuration
3. Add Docker ignore file (.dockerignore)
4. Create container initialization scripts
5. Configure hot-reloading for development
6. Set up database services if needed (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

## 4. Set Up Development Tools and Code Quality Standards [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure linting, formatting, testing, and Git hooks to ensure code quality and consistent development practices.
### Details:
1. Install and configure ESLint:
   - Add TypeScript parser and plugin
   - Configure appropriate rule sets
   - Create .eslintrc.js with shared and workspace-specific rules
2. Set up Prettier:
