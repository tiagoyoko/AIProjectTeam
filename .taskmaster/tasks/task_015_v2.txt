# Task ID: 15
# Title: Develop Integration Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the specialist agent for connecting external tools, creating automations, and ensuring system synchronization
# Details:
1. Implement API integration framework for project management tools
2. Create data mapping between systems
3. Develop automation workflow builder
4. Implement data synchronization logic
5. Create integration health monitoring
6. Develop error handling for external system failures
7. Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies
8. Create integration audit logging

# Test Strategy:
1. Test API connections to supported platforms
2. Validate data mapping accuracy
3. Verify automation workflow execution
4. Test bi-directional synchronization
5. Validate error recovery mechanisms
6. Verify audit log completeness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement API Integration Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible framework for connecting to external project management tools via their APIs, supporting authentication, request handling, and response parsing.
### Details:
Develop a modular API client factory that can generate clients for different external systems. Implement authentication strategies (OAuth, API keys, etc.), request builders with proper error handling, and response parsers. Create interfaces for common operations across different tools (e.g., createTask, updateStatus) that can be implemented for specific integrations. Use dependency injection to allow for easy testing and extension.

## 2. Develop Data Mapping System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create a configurable data mapping system that translates between internal data models and external system formats.
### Details:
Implement a mapping configuration system that defines how fields map between systems. Support both simple field-to-field mappings and complex transformations with custom logic. Create a mapping engine that can apply these configurations to transform data bidirectionally. Include validation to ensure required fields are present and data types match. Develop a UI component for users to configure and test mappings without code changes.

## 3. Create Automation Workflow Builder [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop a system for users to create automated workflows that trigger actions across integrated systems based on events.
### Details:
Implement an event system that can listen for changes in internal and external systems. Create a workflow definition format that specifies triggers, conditions, and actions. Build a workflow engine that executes these definitions when events occur. Develop a visual workflow builder UI with drag-and-drop components for triggers, conditions, and actions. Include templating for dynamic content in actions.

## 4. Implement Data Synchronization Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Build a robust synchronization system that keeps data consistent between internal and external systems, handling conflicts and partial failures.
### Details:
Develop a change tracking system to identify updates in both internal and external systems. Implement conflict resolution strategies (e.g., last-write-wins, manual resolution). Create a synchronization scheduler that can run sync jobs at configurable intervals. Build resumable sync operations that can continue after failures. Implement data versioning to track the history of synchronized items. Add support for both real-time and batch synchronization modes.

## 5. Develop Integration Monitoring and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Create comprehensive monitoring, logging, and error handling systems for integrations, including rate limiting and backoff strategies.
### Details:
Implement integration health checks that verify connectivity and functionality of external systems. Create dashboards showing integration status, sync statistics, and error rates. Develop an error classification system to distinguish between temporary failures, configuration issues, and permanent errors. Implement exponential backoff and jitter for retrying failed operations. Create detailed audit logging for all integration activities with appropriate security controls. Build alerting for critical integration failures.
