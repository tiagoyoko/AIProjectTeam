# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement KPI/OKR Definition Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a structured framework for defining, categorizing, and storing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) within the system.
### Details:
Develop a data model for KPIs/OKRs that includes fields for name, description, category, measurement frequency, target values, actual values, and calculation methods. Implement a schema validation system to ensure data integrity. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations on KPI/OKR definitions. Design a user-friendly interface for defining new metrics and organizing them into hierarchical structures. Include support for custom formulas and composite metrics.

## 2. Create Metric Tracking Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to collect, process, and track metrics data from various project sources to populate the defined KPIs/OKRs with actual values.
### Details:
Implement data connectors for common project management tools (Jira, GitHub, etc.). Create ETL processes to extract relevant metrics. Develop algorithms to calculate derived metrics based on raw data. Implement a scheduling system for regular metric updates. Build a historical data store for tracking changes over time. Include anomaly detection for unexpected metric changes. Create a caching layer for performance optimization.

## 3. Develop Dashboard Generation Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create a system to generate customizable dashboards that visualize KPIs/OKRs and other performance metrics in an intuitive and actionable format.
### Details:
Implement a dashboard template system with common layouts. Create visualization components for different metric types (gauges, charts, tables, etc.). Develop a dashboard configuration interface allowing users to select metrics, visualization types, and layouts. Implement real-time dashboard updates. Add filtering capabilities by time period, project, team, etc. Create export functionality for dashboards (PDF, image, etc.). Implement dashboard sharing and access control.

## 4. Implement Performance Trend Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop capabilities to analyze historical performance data, identify trends, and provide insights on metric patterns over time.
### Details:
Implement time-series analysis algorithms for detecting trends in metrics data. Create statistical models for seasonality detection and decomposition. Develop pattern recognition for common performance patterns (steady growth, plateau, decline, etc.). Implement correlation analysis between different metrics. Create natural language generation for trend descriptions. Develop visualization components specific to trend display. Implement configurable time windows for analysis.

## 5. Develop Project Health Assessment and Forecasting [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive system to evaluate overall project health based on multiple metrics and forecast future performance based on historical trends.
### Details:
Implement a weighted scoring system for overall project health assessment. Create configurable thresholds for health status categories (healthy, at risk, critical). Develop algorithms for earned value metrics calculation (EV, CPI, SPI). Implement burndown/burnup chart generation with trend lines. Create forecasting models using statistical and machine learning approaches. Develop confidence intervals for forecasts. Implement what-if scenario modeling for different future conditions. Create automated recommendations for improving project health based on detected issues.
