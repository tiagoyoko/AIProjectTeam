# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Serverless Architecture and Auto-scaling Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda or Azure Functions and configure auto-scaling to handle varying loads efficiently.
### Details:
1. Choose appropriate serverless platform (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions)
2. Create function templates for key application components
3. Set up API Gateway to route requests to appropriate functions
4. Configure concurrency limits and reserved concurrency for critical functions
5. Implement auto-scaling policies based on CPU utilization, memory usage, and request count
6. Set up CloudWatch/Application Insights for monitoring serverless function performance
7. Document the serverless architecture and scaling configurations

## 2. Develop Caching Strategy and Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a multi-level caching strategy to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
### Details:
1. Identify cacheable data based on access patterns and update frequency
2. Implement application-level caching using memory caches (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
3. Set up CDN caching for static assets
4. Implement browser caching with appropriate cache headers
5. Configure cache invalidation strategies (TTL, event-based invalidation)
6. Implement cache warming for critical data
7. Add cache hit/miss metrics collection
8. Document caching policies and implementation details

## 3. Implement Database Query Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize database queries to improve performance, including indexing, query rewriting, and database configuration tuning.
### Details:
1. Perform query analysis to identify slow-performing queries
2. Create appropriate indexes based on query patterns
3. Rewrite inefficient queries to use indexes effectively
4. Implement database connection pooling
5. Configure query timeouts and resource limits
6. Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads
7. Implement database sharding if necessary
8. Document database optimization strategies and performance benchmarks

## 4. Set Up Load Balancing and Traffic Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances and configure traffic management policies for optimal resource utilization.
### Details:
1. Select appropriate load balancer (Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer)
2. Configure health checks for backend services
3. Implement sticky sessions if required by the application
4. Set up SSL termination at the load balancer
5. Configure traffic distribution policies (round-robin, least connections, etc.)
6. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. Set up geographic routing if applicable
8. Document load balancing configuration and traffic management policies

## 5. Implement Performance Monitoring and Disaster Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive performance monitoring and implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure system reliability and quick recovery from failures.
### Details:
1. Implement application performance monitoring (APM) using tools like New Relic, Datadog, or CloudWatch
2. Set up custom dashboards for key performance metrics
3. Configure alerts for performance degradation and resource constraints
4. Implement distributed tracing for request flows
5. Create automated backup procedures for databases and configuration
6. Set up cross-region replication for critical data
7. Document recovery procedures for different failure scenarios
8. Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to validate the recovery plan
