# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Audit Logging Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational logging framework that will capture and standardize all system events. This includes defining log entry structure, severity levels, and the core logging API that other components will use.
### Details:
Create a centralized logging service with the following components: 1) Define a standardized log entry schema with fields for timestamp, user ID, action type, entity affected, severity level, and additional context. 2) Implement a LoggingService class with methods for different log levels (info, warning, error, etc.). 3) Create middleware/interceptors to automatically capture HTTP requests/responses. 4) Implement a configuration system for controlling log verbosity and output destinations. 5) Add context propagation to maintain request context across asynchronous operations.

## 2. Develop Agent Decision and Action Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Extend the logging framework to capture all agent decisions, including the context, inputs, and reasoning behind automated decisions. This ensures transparency and accountability for AI/agent actions.
### Details:
Enhance the logging framework to capture agent-specific information: 1) Create specialized log entry types for agent decisions with fields for input parameters, decision outcome, confidence score, and reasoning. 2) Implement hooks in the agent decision pipeline to automatically log pre-decision and post-decision states. 3) Add correlation IDs to track related decisions across multiple agents or services. 4) Develop a mechanism to capture and log the decision tree or reasoning path. 5) Implement sampling logic for high-volume decision logging to prevent overwhelming the system.

## 3. Implement User Activity Tracking and Tamper-Proof Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Create a secure, tamper-proof storage system for audit logs with mechanisms to detect unauthorized modifications. Implement comprehensive user activity tracking to record all user interactions with the system.
### Details:
Build a secure storage solution for audit logs: 1) Implement write-once, read-many (WORM) storage pattern for immutable logs. 2) Add cryptographic signatures to log entries to detect tampering. 3) Implement log chaining where each entry contains a hash of the previous entry. 4) Create user activity tracking that captures login/logout events, permission changes, data access, and system configuration changes. 5) Implement log rotation and archiving with integrity verification. 6) Set up separate storage for security-critical vs. regular operational logs.

## 4. Develop Log Search, Filtering and Export Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.3
### Description: Create a flexible and efficient system for searching, filtering, and exporting audit logs. This should support complex queries across multiple dimensions and allow exporting logs in various formats for external analysis.
### Details:
Implement search and export functionality: 1) Create a query API with support for filtering by time range, user, action type, severity, and free text search. 2) Implement pagination and sorting for large result sets. 3) Add advanced filtering with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and field-specific comparisons. 4) Develop export capabilities supporting CSV, JSON, and PDF formats. 5) Implement scheduled/automated exports for regular compliance reporting. 6) Add visualization options for common audit patterns (login attempts, permission changes, etc.).

## 5. Create Compliance Reporting and Retention Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.4
### Description: Implement compliance reporting features and configurable retention policies to meet regulatory requirements. This includes predefined report templates, automated compliance checks, and policy-based log retention.
### Details:
Develop compliance and retention features: 1) Create configurable retention policies based on log type, severity, and regulatory requirements. 2) Implement automated purging of expired logs with appropriate safeguards. 3) Develop predefined compliance report templates for common regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.). 4) Create a compliance dashboard showing key metrics and potential issues. 5) Implement automated compliance checks that alert on suspicious patterns or policy violations. 6) Add audit trails for the log system itself (who viewed logs, exported data, etc.).
